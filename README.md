# hexes

A directory of all english words that are also valid hex color codes.

The UI was just a fun grid layout experiment using `display: flex` and messing around with jQuery animations. Built while binge-watching Twin Peaks for the third time. If you find any other words that are missing, let me know and I'll add them!
